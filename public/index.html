          <h3>Strings</h3>
        </header>
        <p>JavaScript strings are used for storing and manipulating text. A JavaScript string is zero or more characters written inside quotes.</p>
        <p>
          <code><p>var carname = "Volvo XC60";  // Double quotes</p>
        <p>var carname = 'Volvo XC60';  // Single quotes</p></code>
        </p>
        <p>You can use quotes inside a string, as long as they don't match the quotes surrounding the string:

          <p>
            <code>
    <p>var answer = "It's alright";</p>
    <p>var answer = "He is called 'Johnny'";</p>
    <p>var answer = 'He is called "Johnny"';</p>
      </code>
          </p>


        </p>

          <h3>Variables</h3>
        </header>
        <p>JavaScript variables are containers for storing data values. All JavaScript variables must be identified with unique names. These unique names are called identifiers. Identifiers can be short names (like x and y) or more descriptive names (age,
          sum, totalVolume). The general rules for constructing names for variables (unique identifiers) are: Names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs. Names must begin with a letter Names can also begin with $ and _ (but we will
          not use it in this tutorial) Names are case sensitive (y and Y are different variables) Reserved words (like JavaScript keywords) cannot be used as names JavaScript identifiers are case-sensitive.
          <br>
          <code>var x = 5;
        var y = 6;
        var z = x + y;</code></p>
        <p>The Assignment Operator
        </p>
        <p> In JavaScript, the equal sign (=) is an "assignment" operator, not an "equal to" operator. This is different from algebra. The following does not make sense in algebra:
          <p><code>x = x + 5</code>
          </p>In JavaScript, however, it makes perfect sense: it assigns the value of x + 5 to x. (It calculates the value of x + 5 and puts the result into x. The value of x is incremented by 5.)
        </p>
        <p>JavaScript Data Types</p>
        <p>JavaScript variables can hold numbers like 100 and text values like "John Doe". In programming, text values are called text strings. JavaScript can handle many types of data, but for now, just think of numbers and strings. Strings are written
          inside double or single quotes. Numbers are written without quotes. If you put a number in quotes, it will be treated as a text string.

          <p>
            <code>
                <p>var pi = 3.14;</p>
                <p>var person = "John Doe";</p>
                <p>var answer = 'Yes I am!';</p>
                </code>
          </p>
        </p>
        <p>Declaring (Creating) JavaScript Variables</p>
        <p>Creating a variable in JavaScript is called "declaring" a variable. You declare a JavaScript variable with the var keyword:

          <p>
            <code>
              var carName;
            </code>
          </p>
          After the declaration, the variable has no value. (Technically it has the value of undefined) To assign a value to the variable, use the equal sign:
          <p>
            <code>
          carName = "Volvo";
        </code>
          </p>
          You can also assign a value to the variable when you declare it:
          <p>
            <code>
            var carName = "Volvo";
          </code>
          </p>
        </p>
        <p>One Statement, Many Variables</p>
        You can declare many variables in one statement. Start the statement with var and separate the variables by comma:
        <p>
          <code>
          <p>var person = "John Doe", carName = "Volvo", price = 200;</p>
        </code>
        </p>
        </p>
